## Usage

To analyze the bundle size:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

To run in development with Turbopack:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Results

- Improved First Contentful Paint (FCP) with skeleton loaders
- Better Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) with image optimizations
- Reduced Total Blocking Time (TBT) with lazy loading
- Enhanced user experience with smooth loading states
